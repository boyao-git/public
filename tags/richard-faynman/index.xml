      <description>I watched BBC Horizon&amp;rsquo;s interview with Richard Faynman, which was first broadcasted around 40 years ago.
The episode is called [The Pleasure of Finding Things Out]. I was intrigued by the title wanted to find out what he said about &amp;lsquo;finding out&amp;rsquo;. Plus I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist his big smile in the thumbnail.
Faynman was one of the greatest physicists of all time. Although he was not born in an academic family, his father had heavy influences on his later scientific career.</description>
