  "articleBody": "I watched BBC Horizon’s interview with Richard Feynman, which was first broadcasted around 40 years ago.\nThe episode is called [The Pleasure of Finding Things Out]. I was intrigued by the title wanted to find out what he said about ‘finding out’. Plus I couldn’t resist his big smile in the thumbnail.\nFeynman was one of the greatest physicists of all time. Although he was not born in an academic family, his father had heavy influences on his later scientific career. Why? He taught young Feynman two things: 1) the difference between true values and ‘uniforms’; 2) the difference between knowing and understanding.\nFeynman’s father was in the uniform business. He understands that humans tend to organise themselves by ‘uniforms’. People bow to the Pope not because the Pope is an inspiration or has done some amazing work, but because that man is wearing the Pope’s uniform and in a position of power. Underneath that uniform, the Pope is no different from any other human beings. Young Feynman learned from his father to appreciate ‘the real things’ and disrespect any imaginary uniforms like one’s title, position or wealth. This attitude guided him to dedicate his mental energy to the physics he loved, and to challenge authorities in his field without fear (e.g., Niels Bohr).\nWhen Feynman was young, his father took him to walk in the woods. He would point at a bird and ask, “What is that?” Feynman would reply, “I don’t know.” His father would teach him the name of that bird in different languages and then pointed out, “Now you know what the bird is called but you still know nothing about the bird. Let’s go find out what it does.” This was a revelation to young Feynman, that it is more important to understand how something works than to know what it is called. The father and son would go on to observe the bird’s behaviour and make guesses on, e.g., why the bird would tidy its feathers. They would then make further observations to confirm whether the guesses were right or not, just as one does in science. Feynman was taught to find things out for the sake of it at a very young age, which made him grow into a legendary scientist of his time.\nAt the age of 28, having lost both his wife and father, Feynman went into depression. He was mentally unfit to work on university research projects and decided to kill his time by figuring out ‘less important’ physics problems for the fun of it. In a cafeteria at Cornell, he saw the twirling and nutation of a dinner plate when tossed in the air. He found the nutating plate fascinating and worked to explain the rotation mathematically, which eventually led to his Nobel Prize-winning work on quantum electrodynamics.\nI find his story fascinating and familiar. This is not the first time I hear legendary scientists talking about them ‘playing’ their way to Nobel Prizes, not that the Prize was of any importance to them. As Feynman said in the interview, “I don’t understand that it’s all about or what’s worth what, but if the people in the Swedish Academy decide that x, y or z wins the Nobel Prize, then so be it.” For him, he already had the prize - the pleasure of finding things out.\nI am envious of Feynman’s freedom or perhaps his audacity to ‘do absolutely nothing and just do something for the fun of it’. I thought that was what scientists do, but having reflected on my career so far, I must be doing it wrong.\nI tried to produce 4* papers.\nI tried to get grants.\nI did lots of teaching and curriculum developments.\nI made lots of money for the university.\nI have been running on the Metrics Wheel.\nI have been a good boy.\nIs this how life ought to be lived? Where did the fun go?\nSo I took the time to write my thoughts down, just for the fun of it.\nFeynman says it takes a great amount of efforts to truly understand a scientific problem. I think that applies to life, too. I ought to find pleasure in the things I do, and not to do them for the ‘uniforms’.\nI read he died of liposarcoma, a rare form of cancer in fat cells, at the age of 69.\nI always feel sad when legends don’t live long enough.\nBut I also feel relieved that their spirits do live on and are channeled through the generations.\nIt’s my pleasure finding you out.\nThank you, Feynman.\n",

<p>I watched BBC Horizon&rsquo;s interview with Richard Feynman, which was first broadcasted around 40 years ago.</p>
<p>The episode is called [The Pleasure of Finding Things Out].  I was intrigued by the title wanted to find out what he said about &lsquo;finding out&rsquo;.  Plus I couldn&rsquo;t resist his big smile in the thumbnail.</p>
<p>Feynman was one of the greatest physicists of all time.  Although he was not born in an academic family, his father had heavy influences on his later scientific career.  Why?  He taught young Feynman two things: 1) the difference between true values and ‘uniforms’; 2) the difference between knowing and understanding.</p>
<p>Feynman&rsquo;s father was in the uniform business.  He understands that humans tend to organise themselves by &lsquo;uniforms&rsquo;.

This attitude guided him to dedicate his mental energy to the physics he loved, and to challenge authorities in his field without fear (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr">Niels Bohr</a>).</p>
<p>When Feynman was young, his father took him to walk in the woods.
